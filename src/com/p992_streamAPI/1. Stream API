Stream API: (java.util.stream -> contains methods, classes, interfaces) -> java 8
- used to process collections of objects
- a stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods that can be pipelined to produce
  desired result

Stream API has only one interface:
- java.util.stream.Stream
Note: obj of this Stream(I) represents sequence of obj from a source like collections

- the Stream interface has two types of methods:
  1) terminal methods
  2) intermediate methods


Miscellaneous point about stream:
    1. only objects, no primitives
    2. doesn't store elements, only represents in sequence (wire doesn't store electricity)
    3. operations (filtering) performed on stream doesn't modify original source
    4. streams are lazy, evaluates code only when required
    5. elements of a stream, only visited once during the life of a stream, a new stream must be
       generated to revisit the same elements of the source
