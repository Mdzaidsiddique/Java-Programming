What is encapsulation:
- one of four pillars of oop
- encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) & methods into single unit (class)
- and restricting direct access to some of other object's components

Why to use:
- to hide internal details of an object
- to protect data from outside interfaces (unauthorized access)
- to follow data security & integrity

How to achieve encapsulation:
- declare variables as private
- provide public getter & setter methods to access/modify them

Key benefits:
- improve security
- better control over data
- easy to update/maintain
- reusability & clear code structure
