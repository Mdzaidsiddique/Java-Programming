Result Set:
- ResultSet is an interface in java.sql package
- it represents the tabular result of executing a SQL query (usually a SELECT statement)
- each row in the result corresponds to one record from the database
- you can iterate over the rows and retrieve column values

Cursor in ResultSet:
- RS has a cursor that points to rows
- At first, the cursor is positioned before the first row, we must call next() to move it to the first row

- rs.next() - true (if row is present) and false (if no rows are there)
- rs.getInt() - get int value from a columns
- rs.getString()- get String value from column
- close(), etc

ResultSet is a table-like cursor that lets you read (and sometimes update) data returned from a SQL query in JDBC.
