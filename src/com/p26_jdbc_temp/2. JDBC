JDBC: Java Database Connectivity (to connect java application with RDBMS db)
- an API to connect & execute queries (CRUD) with db
- JDBC API used JDBC Driver to connect with db

Java - JDBC API - JDBC Driver - Database

JDBC Driver: main component to establish the connection between Java application and database

there are 4 types of jdbc driver:
    1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge - slow
    2. Native API Driver - medium
    3. Network Protocol Driver - medium
    4. Thin Driver (Pure Java) - fast

in modern applications, Type-4 (Thin Driver) is used almost everywhere
- that’s what you’re using when you write: Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
- note: before that must have to configure mysql driver jar (refer - setup file above)

Class.forName();
    - static method form java.lang.Class class (part of java base module)
    - Class is a special class in Java that represents metadata about classes and interfaces at runtime
    - forName(String className) loads a class dynamically when you give its fully qualified name (FQN)

when Class.forName() of jdbc executes, three thong happens in the background:
    1) driver related main class loaded to the primary memory
    2) driver related main class created
    3) driver object registered with DriverManager class

there are 5 steps to connect any java app with db using JDBC:
1) register driver class (Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");)

2) create the connection object:
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
   - url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db-name"
   - username = "root", pass = "root"

3) create statement object: (once we get the connection obj then can execute any sql statement)
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement() - throws SQLException

4) execute the query:
    - public int executeUpdate(String sql);
    - public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql);
    - etc

5) close the connection: connection.close()
   note: since java 7, JDBC has a ability (try with resource) to auto close resources of type
         connection, statement & ResultSet (it void explicit closing step)
