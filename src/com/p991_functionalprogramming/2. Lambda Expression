lambda expression:
- anonymous or unnamed method
- lambda expression doesn't execute on its own
- instead it is to implement a method defined by functional interface

Miscellaneous Points about lambda expressions:
    - In the argument list, mentioning data type is optional
    - In the case of a single parameter () is optional but for zero or more than one parameter it is compulsory
    - For a single statement body, curly brackets are optional
    - Use of the return keyword is optional if the body of the lambda function is of one statement only
    - Lambda expressions are treated as a methods so .class file is not generated for them
        - a lambda expression looks like a method, but technically itâ€™s not a method in Java
        - it is an instance of a functional interface
        - when you write a lambda, the compiler does not create a new .class file for it (unlike anonymous inner classes which do).
