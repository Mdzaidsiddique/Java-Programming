Inheritance: is-a relationship: extends keyword:
- Parent-child relationship between classes
- it bring variables & methods from parent/base/super class to child/sub/derived class
- in order to re-use

- the idea behind inheritance is to create new class that are build upon existing classes
- can user methods, variables of parent class into its child class
- can add new methods

Types of inheritance in java:
    - single (class, interface)
    - multi-level (class, interface)
    - hierarchical (class, interface)
    - multiple (interface)
    - hybrid (interface)

why multiple & hybrid is not supported in java class level?
    - because of diamond problem
    - if 2 classes inherited by a class and both classes having same method, then ambiguity problem
    - compile time error is better than run time error

- final class can not be extended (i.e, final class doesn't have child class)
