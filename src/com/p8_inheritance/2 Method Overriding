Method Overriding:
    - child class object can access the methods of its parent class
    - child class can re-implement the methods of parent class known as method overriding
    - we cannot override static methods
    - any final methods can not be override in child class

Uses:
    - used to provide specific implementation to methods provided by super class
    - method overriding is used for run time polymorphism

rules:
    1) method must have same name & same parameter
    2) there must be is-a relationship (inheritance)
    3) we should use @override annotation (java.lang package) to validate valid methods overriding at compile time
