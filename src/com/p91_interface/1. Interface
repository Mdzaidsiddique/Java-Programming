- interface in java is a collection of abstract methods
- interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction
- since java 8, we can define static & default methods in interface
- both abstract class & interface can't be instantiated

default methods:
- default methods have the default implementation, but didn't affect the intention behind interface
- need not to override inside implementation class

static method:
- statics method can be called independently without object
- static methods are not inherited, it can be called with the help of interface name

difference between abstract class & interface:

abstract class: (0-100%) partial abstraction
    - can have abstract and non-abstract methods
    - support final, non-final, static, non-static variables
    - can provide implementation of an interface

interface: (100% abstraction)
    - interface can only have abstract methods (since java 8, default & static)
    - supports only static & final variables
    - support multiple inheritance
    - interface enables late binding (run time polymorphism- method overriding)

Marker/Tagged interface:
    - an interface that has no member
    - ex, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc
    - they are used to provide some essential information to JVM to perform useful operations


which should use? abstract class or interface?
✅ Use an interface when:
    - You want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can implement
    - You want to achieve full abstraction (no method implementation)
    - You want to support multiple inheritance (Java allows multiple interfaces but only one class to extend)
    - You are building plug-and-play behavior (like Comparable, Runnable, etc.)

✅ Use an abstract class when:
    - You want to share common code (method implementation) among related classes
    - You want to define state (fields/variables) along with behavior
    - You may need constructors, non-static initialization blocks, or protected members
    - You expect classes to be closely related (e.g., Vehicle, Car, Truck)
