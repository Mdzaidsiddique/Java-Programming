Map.Entry Interface:
- Entry is the inner interface defined inside the map interface
- accessed by Map.Entry name
- it returns a collection view of the map
- each key-value pair is called as one entry, hence map is considered as group of entries
- without existing map object there is no chance of existing entry object (because Entry(I) defined inside Map(I))

Methods of Map.Entry interface:
  - public K getKey(); It is used to obtain a key.
  - public V getValue(); It is used to obtain a value.
  - public V setValue(V value); It is used to replace the value corresponding to this entry with the specified value

Note: Since Entry is an inner interface defined inside the Map interface, we define the variable of
      this Entry interface with the help of its outer interface Map
    - Example: Map.Entry me;
