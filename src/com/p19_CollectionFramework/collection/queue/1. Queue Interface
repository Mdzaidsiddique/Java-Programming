Queue(I): first in first out (FIFO)
 |
PriorityQueue(C):
- It is a queue data structure where elements are ordered according to their priority, not just insertion order (like in a normal queue)
- Internally, it is implemented using a Binary Heap (a complete binary tree)
- By default, it is a min-heap → smallest element has the highest priority and comes out first

key features:
- ordering: (default natural (comparable), can customize using comparator)
- no null allowed
- duplicates allowed
- Not thread-safe (If multiple threads need access, use PriorityBlockingQueue)

Common Methods:
    - add(E e) / offer(E e) → insert element
    - peek() → get head element (highest priority) without removing
    - poll() → get and remove head element
    - remove(Object o) → remove specific element
    - size() → number of elements

Note: the internal ordering is priority-based, not insertion order
    - Example: If you insert [30, 10, 20], the queue may internally store them as [10, 30, 20]
      depending on heap arrangement, but the head will always be the smallest (10)
