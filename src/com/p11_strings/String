- string is a sequence of characters surrounded by ""
- predefined class in java.lang package

- syntax: String message = "hello world"
  here, message is the variable, which is initialized with string object
      - "hello world" is not a primitive type
      - this message variable is a reference variable of type string class

In Java, the JVM maintain has a string pool to store all of its strings inside the memory
- string pool: helps re-using the string

String s1 = "Welcome"; // string literals
String s2 = "Welcome";

Here, we are directly providing the value “Welcome”. Hence, the compiler first checks the string pool
      to see if this string already exists.
      - If this string already exists: the new string is not created and the reference point of already existing
       "welcome" is provided
      - If string doesn't exist: the new string "Welcome" is created inside this string pool area.

i.e: s1 == s2 (output: true)

String s3 = new String("Welcome");
- Here the value of the string is not directly provided, hence a new “Welcome” string is created inside the
- heap memory even though the “Welcome” string object is already present inside the string pool area.

s1 == s3 (output: false)
