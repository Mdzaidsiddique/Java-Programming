- scanner class belong to java.util
- to read inputs from different sources like (input stream, users, files, etc

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)
- system.in -> used to take input from standard input (just like taking input from keyboard)

Java Scanner Methods to Take Input:

the scanner class provides various methods that allow us to read inputs of different types:
    - next(): reads a word from the user
    - nextLine(): reads a whole line
    - nextInt(): reads an int value from the user
    - nextFloat(): reads a float value form the user
    - nextBoolean(): reads a boolean value from the user
    - nextByte(): reads a byte value from the user
    - nextDouble(): reads a double value from the user
    - nextShort(): reads a short value from the user
    - nextLong(): reads a long value from the user

Difference between next() & nextLine():
    - next() : reads inputs up to the whitespaces (exclude whitespaces), it terminates when encounter whitespaces
    - nextLine() : reads the entire line including whitespaces & terminates when encounter next line char '\n'

sc.close(): always close scanner (good practice)
