paradigm: way of writing code (style)
        - to develop a computer application, we have various programming paradigms (procedural, functional, Object-oriented, etc)

java support multiple paradigms:
        - object oriented (core paradigm of java)
        - functional (since Java 8:	lambda, streams, functional interfaces)
        - concurrent (multi-threading, synchronization, parallel streams)
        - imperative (statements, loops, conditions)
        - structured (sequence, selection (if-else), iteration (loops))

Oops & functional are two most popular programming paradigms
