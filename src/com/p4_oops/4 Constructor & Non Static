Difference between non static and constructor:
- method name can be anything but constructor name must be same as class name
- method must have return type at-least void, but constructor shouldn't have any return type
- a method can be called anytime, but constructor will be called at the time of object creation only
- method can be static, final & abstract but constructor can't be static, final & abstract

similarities between non static and constructor:
- constructor can be overloaded similar to method overloading
