HashMap & HashTable:
    - both are used to stored data in key-values from
    - both are using hashing technique to store unique keys

Differences:
HashMap - HashMap is non Synchronized, not thread-safe
        - can't be shared bw many thread without proper synchronized code
        - allow only one null key and multiple null values

HashTable - synchronized, thread-safe & can be shared with multiple threads
          - HashTable doesn't allow any null keys or values
