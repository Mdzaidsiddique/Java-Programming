collection:
- a group of individual objects which are represented as single unit, known as collection of object

java collection fw:
- JCF is the set of predefined classes & interfaces from java.util package that helps you store,
  manage & manipulate collection of objects
- collections are like container where we can store & manipulate group of objects in a standard way
* with the help of array we can also do the same but arrays are static (size)

Difference b/w Arrays & Collections:
    - Arrays are having fixed size (add element up to specified size only) -> ArrayOutOfBoundException
    - Collections are dynamic in nature
    - Arrays allows homogeneous elements only -> IncompatibleTypes
    - Collections allow heterogeneous elements -> No Error
    - in case of collections pre defined methods are there for searching, sorting, but not in arrays

Collection Framework -> it contains 2 section:
    1) collection (multiple objects are handled individually)
    2) map (multiple objects handled in key-value pairs)


    java.lang.Iterable(I)
             |
        Collection(I)
    _________|__________
   |         |          |
 List(I)   Set(I)    Queue(I)

List(I)
    -> ArrayList(C),
    -> LinkedList(C), also implements Deque(I) from java 1.5 onwards
    -> Vector(C) -> Stack(C)

Set(I)
    -> HashSet(C) -> LinkedHashSet(C)
    -> SortedSet(I) -> TreeSet(C)

Queue(I)
    -> PriorityQueue(C)
    -> Deque(I) -> ArrayDeque(C), LinkedList(C) [since java 1.5]

Primitives in collections:
    - collections doesn't allow primitives, it only deals with objects
    - we need to store in corresponding wrapper class in order to use primitives
    - internally collections use auto-boxing & auto-unboxing to store primitives
    - for example:
        ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        arrayList.add(10);

auto-boxing & auto-unboxing:
    - the automatic conversion of primitives data types to its equivalent Wrapper class is non as
      boxing & it's opposite is unboxing
