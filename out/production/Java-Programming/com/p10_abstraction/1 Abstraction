Abstraction:
- it is the process of hiding implementation and showing only functionality to the user
- it lets you focus on what the object does, instead of how it does

There are 2 ways to achieve abstraction:

1) Abstract Class (0-100%)
2) Interface (100%), since java 8, we have default methods

Abstract Class:
    - a class declare with abstract keyword
    - it need to be extended & its method implemented
    - it can not be instantiated (can not create object)
    - it can have abstract and non abstract methods
    - it can have constructor, static and main methods also
    - oit can have final methods, that will force subclass not to change the body of the method

Abstract Method:
    - don't have body, only method signature (no implementation)
    - achieve by abstract modifier
    - sub class must override and provide definition to abstract methods
    - if method is abstract, thee class must be abstract
    - The abstract keyword is NOT necessary in interface because all methods in interfaces were implicitly public abstract
    - but in abstract class it is mandatory

- abstract can not be final, static & private
