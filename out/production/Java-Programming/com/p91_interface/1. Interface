- interface in java is a collection of abstract methods
- interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction
- since java 8, we can define static & default methods in interface
- both abstract class & interface can't be instantiated

default methods:
- default methods have the default implementation, but didn't affect the intention behind interface
- need not to override inside implementation class

static method:
- statics method can be called independently without object
- static methods are not inherited, it can be called with the help of interface name

difference between abstract class & interface:

abstract class: (0-100%) partial abstraction
    - can have abstract and non-abstract methods
    - support final, non-final, static, non-static variables
    - can provide implementation of an interface

interface: (100% abstraction)
    - interface can only have abstract methods (since java 8, default & static)
    - supports only static & final variables
    - support multiple inheritance
    - interface enables late binding (run time polymorphism- method overriding)
