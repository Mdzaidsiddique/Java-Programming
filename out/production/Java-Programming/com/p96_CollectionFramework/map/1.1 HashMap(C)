HashMap Class:

- HashMap(C) implements Map(I), allow us to store key-value pairs
- Key should be unique (if try to insert duplicate then it will replace corresponding key)
- Elements inserted based on the hashCode (doesn't follow sequence)
- only one null key & multiple null values are allowed

LinkedHashMap(C):
- this is a child class of HashMap
- preserve the sequence of all entries
