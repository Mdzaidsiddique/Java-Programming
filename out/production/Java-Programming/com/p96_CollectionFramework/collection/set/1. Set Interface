Set Interface(I):
    - set interface extends the collection interface
    - unordered and don't allow duplicate items
    - implemented by HashSet(C), LinkedHashSet(C) & TreeSet(C)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

HashSet class:
    - no duplicates & no insertion order preserved
    - at most one null value can be added in HashSet object
    - if frequent operation is searching [O(1)] then HashSet is best choice (internally use hashing
      technique to store the objects)

syntax: HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
    - the initial capacity of hashset is 16 & default load factor is 0.75
    - that means 16 * 0.75 = 12, on the insertion of 12th element the capacity will doubled (32)

* since set doesn't follow index so we can't use for loop for any set implemented classes (HS, LHS, TS)
  but we can use enhanced for loop or iterator to traverse elements for these objects

LinkedHashSet class:
    - this class is the child class of HashSet class, but it preserve the insertion order
