binding: connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding

Early (static) Binding:
- when type of an object determine at compile time (by compiler)
- happens with method overloading, private, static & final method
- compiler knows which method to call
- less flexible

Late (dynamic) Binding:
- when type of an object determine at run time
- happens with method overriding
- more flexible
