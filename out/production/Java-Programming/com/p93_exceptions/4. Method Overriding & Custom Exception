Method overriding rules with exception and Custom Exception:

1) if super class method exception doesn't declare with throws clause:
    - in this case sub class overridden method cannot declare checked exception but can unchecked exception

2) if the super class exception declare exception with throws clause:
    - in this case sub class can declare same exception or no exception
    - but subclass overridden method can't declare parent class exception of declared exception

*User defined CustomException in java:
    - java provides almost all the exception that may occur, however we can create our own exception as well
    - if user defined exception class extends java.lang.Exception class then it will become checked exception
    - if extends java.lang.RuntimeException class then it becomes un-checked exception

syntax:
    public class MyCustomException extends Exception/RuntimeException{

        // constructor
        public MyCustomException(String message){
            super(message);
        }
    }
