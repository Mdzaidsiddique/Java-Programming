- in object oriented programming everything is based on the concept called object
- these objects are the basic units going to contain some data called (state)
- and operations on these data called methods or (behaviour)

benefits:
    - reduce complexity
    - easier maintenance
    - code reusability
    - faster development

class & object:
    - class is a template or blueprint of an object, whereas object is a instance of a class
    - class is the virtual encapsulation of properties & behaviour
    - object is physical encapsulation of properties & behaviour
    - the main purpose of a class is to represent all real world entities in java application

    Class{

        - variables (properties) -- (data/ state)
        - methods (behaviour)

    }

instance variable: inside the class & outside the methods
local variable: inside the methods

Note: Inside a class, there will be two types of elements are there:
      1. static elements
      2. non-static elements(instance variables and methods)


All the static elements will be loaded into RAM first, and all the non-static elements will be there
inside the hard disk in the form of byte code in the .class file.

now JVM searches for the main
method and control start the execution of a Java program from the first line of the main method.

The Complete signature of the main method is :
