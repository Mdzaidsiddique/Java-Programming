- in object oriented programming everything is based on the concept called object
- these objects are the basic units going to contain some data called (state)
- and operations on these data called methods or (behaviour)

benefits:
    - reduce complexity
    - easier maintenance
    - code reusability
    - faster development

class & object:
    - class is a template or blueprint of an object, whereas object is a instance of a class
    - class is the virtual encapsulation of properties & behaviour
    - object is physical encapsulation of properties & behaviour
