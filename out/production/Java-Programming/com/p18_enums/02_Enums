Enums & Inheritance:

- All Enum implicitly extends Enums class (from java.lang package)
- as, a class can only extends one parent in java so, enum can't extends anything else
- toString() method is overridden in Enum class, which returns enum constant name
- enum can implements many interface

values() & ordinal() method: (both presents in java.lang.Enum class)
- values(): returns arrays of constants
- ordinal(): return index

We can have constructors, methods and fields inside enums type, which make them very powerful

Constructor in Enum:
- Enum can contain constructor, it will executed separately for each enum constant (RED, BLUE) when enum class loading
- we can't create object of enum explicitly, hence we can't invoke the enum constructor directly.
- constructor of enum is private, if u don't declare compiler internally declare private constructor.
