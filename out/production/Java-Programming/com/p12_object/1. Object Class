Object Class:
- belongs to java.lang package
- every class in java directly or indirectly derived from the object class
- if a class doesn't extent any class then it is a in-direct child of Object class
- therefore the object class methods are available to all the java classes

- beneficial, if you want to refer any object whose type you don't know (upcasting)
    - Object obj=getObject(); //we don't know what object will be returned from this method

------------------------------------------
Methods of Object Class:
1. public final Class getClass():
    - returns the Class class object of this object.
    - The Class class can further be used to get the metadata of this class

2. public int hashCode():
    - returns the hashcode number for this object

3. public boolean equals(Object obj)
    - compares the given object to this object

4. protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException:
    - creates and returns the exact copy (clone) of this object

5. public String toString():
    - returns the string representation of this object

Multithreading:
1. public final void notify():
    - wakes up single thread, waiting on this object's monitor

2. public final void notifyAll():
    - wakes up all the threads, waiting on this object's monitor

3. public final void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException:
    - causes the current thread to wait for the specified milliseconds,
    - until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method)

4. public final void wait(long timeout,int nanos) throws InterruptedException:
    - causes the current thread to wait for the specified milliseconds and nanoseconds,
    - until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method)

5. public final void wait() throws InterruptedException:
    - causes the current thread to wait, until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method)

6. protected void finalize() throws Throwable:
    - is invoked by the garbage collector before object is being garbage collected
