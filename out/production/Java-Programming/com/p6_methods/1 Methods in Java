Methods: (set of instructions) used to perform certain actions, also known as functions
    - a block of codes that only runs when it called
    - we can pass data known as parameter
    - method can return some value or print
    - define methods to re-use code multiple times
    - return type is must at-least void (void means the method does not return anything)

Types of methods:
    1) concrete method: both method declaration and implementation, at least empty body.
    2) abstract method: only method declaration, abstract keyword is must

Methods with parameter:
    - parameters to supply input data to perform action (all primitive & user defined are allowed)

Methods with class as parameter:
    - if we take any class as parameter, then to call that method we have 3 possible values
    - 1) same class object
    - 2) child class object
    - 3) null (method will be called but when control reach to inside method -> NullPointerException (Not recommended)
