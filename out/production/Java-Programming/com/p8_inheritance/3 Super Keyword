Super:
    - reference variable used to refer immediate parent class object
    - whenever we create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created
      implicitly, which is referred by super variable reference

- default constructor also adds super() at first line (hidden)
-  super() must always be the first line in a constructor

Uses:
    - to refer immediate parent class instance variable
    - invoke immediate parent class instance methods
    - invoke immediate parent class constructor
