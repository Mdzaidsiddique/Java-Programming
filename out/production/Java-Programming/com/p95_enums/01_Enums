Enum in java is a data type that contains a fixed set of constants. (Convention- Capital laters)
It can be used for:
    - Days: SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY,  SATURDAY
    - Months: JAN, FEB, MARCH, APR, MAY, etc.
    - Season: SPRING, SUMMER, WINTER, AUTUMN
    - Directions: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
    - Colors: RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, etc.

- Enums can not be declared inside a methods (it can be outside or inside class)
- Enums can have main methods inside it as well

Every enum internally implemented by class, and every enum type represents an object of type Enum.
- for example, if we have enums like this:
    enum Color{ RED, BLUE }
- it internally converted as:
    final class color extends enum{
        public static final Color RED = new Color();
        public static final Color BLUE = new Color():
    }
